title: Align Custom Classes and ID Test
---
{~ align class="my-outer-class another-outer" id="specific-align-block" content_class="my-inner-content-class" ~}
This block should have:
- Outer div with classes: `my-outer-class another-outer`
- Outer div with ID: `specific-align-block`
- Inner content div with class: `my-inner-content-class`
Styling for these would come from user CSS.
